# Security

Report vulnerabilities privately through a
[security advisory on this repository](https://github.com/Nitjsefnie-Actions/comment-ratchet/security/advisories/new),
not the public issue tracker. Include the action commit SHA, calling workflow,
inputs, source fixture, records file and observed behavior needed to reproduce.

In scope are the action, its parsing of consumer-controlled source and inputs,
its dependency installs, ratchet enforcement and the repository's workflows.
Inputs must remain environment data; consumer code must never execute while
being measured. High-value reports demonstrate code execution from a source
fixture or a check that accepts a forbidden rise. Reproduce only in a
repository you control.

## What happens after you report

A report is acknowledged within three working days. That acknowledgement is a
person confirming they have read it, not a verdict — the assessment follows.

You will get an assessment within ten working days: whether it reproduces, what
it affects, and if it is accepted, a rough idea of when a fix will land. If it
takes longer than that, you will be told why rather than left waiting.

Those two clocks are one person's working days. The project has one
maintainer, as [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) explains, so the promises
above are conditional on that person being available to work on a report. A
promise kept is kept as written, and a slow answer can reflect that person's availability rather than anything about the
report. That availability is also what carries the explanation: when it runs
out the reason runs out with it, so a report can pass ten working days with
neither an assessment nor the account of why there is none, and nobody else
will answer — this file refuses the public tracker, and there is no second
maintainer to ask.

Disclosure is coordinated with you. A fix is released before any public
description, and the advisory credits you unless you ask otherwise. Ninety days
after the report is the point at which disclosure happens regardless, so a
report cannot be buried by being left unanswered. That disclosure is carried by
the same one person the clocks above are. Ninety days remains the target, and
if that person is unavailable when the ninety days fall due, the advisory
publishes when they return — the commitment is scoped to the same availability,
not withdrawn. What a reporter can rely on if the day falls due with the
person still away is that this file never asks a report to be held past ninety
days: the choice to disclose is the reporter's own at that point.

If a report is declined, you will be told the reason. Disagreeing with that is
reasonable, and saying so is welcome.
